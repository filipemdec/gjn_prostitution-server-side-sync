# 🔞🚗 gjn_prostitution (Server-Sync Fork)

> **Fork notice:** This repository is a **fork** of **gjn_prostitution** by **Gojaneu / GJN Scripts**.  
> ✅ **All core logic & content belongs to the original author.**  
> 🔧 **Modification by Filipe (OFFMETA):** refactored the actions to be **server-synced**, so nearby players can see the in-vehicle actions properly.

## ✨ What's different from upstream?
- 🌐 **Server-side sync:** actions/events are now **replicated** (not only client-side).
- 👥 **Visibility:** players nearby can **see** the actions happening inside the vehicle.
- 🧼 Goal: keep the original behavior while improving **network consistency**.

## 🙏 Credits
- **Original resource:** Gojaneu / GJN Scripts (upstream project)
- **Server-side sync refactor:** Filipe (OFFMETA)
